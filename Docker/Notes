Dockerfile:
****************

It is a simple text file

the name of the file is going be always 'dockerfile' OR 'Dockerfile'

It is a file that consist of instructions or commands needed to build an Image

 dockerfile ---> Build ---> Image

Format of dockerfile
********

Instruction argument

keywords or instructions in dockerfile

1.comment

# this is a comment

2. FROM 

** every docker file will start with a FROM keyword, only one FROM in a dockerfile

- specifies the base image from which you are building your custom Image

for eg: 

FROM ubuntu


3. RUN

 - use to run any linux command in the image
 - create file/directory or to install, uninstall, uprgrade package
 - multiple RUN can be there in a dockerfile

for eg:

 RUN yum install tomcat -y


4. CMD

 - specifies a command to executed when container is created

for eg:

 CMD ["run" "catalina.sh"] == start tomcat server


  
5. ENTRYPOINT

 - specifies the default process of the container that should run on container launch

6. VOLUME

  -- specifies the container directory to preserve data on docker host


for eg:

  VOLUME /var/www/html  == data is to be preserved on the docker host ==> docker will take care of creating a mount point

7. EXPOSE

   -- specifies the container port where the application is available

8. COPY : copy the files from host machine to container directory

  for eg:

  COPY <host source file> <conatinerdest>
  
  COPY index.html /var/www/html


9. ADD:
     copy the files from host machine to container directory
     Copy the compressed tar file from host machine  as a uncompressed file to container directory
     COPY files from a remote URL to your container directory

10. ENV:

- specifies environment variables to be used in dockerfile

  for eg:

   ENV packageName nginx1.2

   RUN yum install $packageName -y

11. WORKDIR

- speciifes the directory where all the instruction/commands of dockerfile has to be executed

 > by default the workdir for a container is /

for eg:

 workdir /myapp

 
Label : metadata


Dockerfile Examples:

FROM ubuntu
RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install git -y


Build dockerfile into an image

 > docker build -t Imagename:tagname .

when you build a dockerfile--> each instruciton will be built into a filesystem




***********************************************************************************


Networking in docker
*****************
There are 3 types of networks when working with single docker host

> bridge
> host
> None

To check your networks:

$ docker network ls

To Hceck containers created in a network:

$ docker inspect <netwrokName>

Sceanrio 1:
****************************
Create 2 containers and Check their network and see if they can communicate with each other


Container 1:

 docker run -itd --name c1 busybox

c1 : 172.17.0.2

Container 2:

 docker run -itd --name c2 busybox

c2: 172.17.0.3

** When containers are in Same network they can communicate with each other


Scenario 2:
******************
Create your custom netwrok of driver type - bridge

docker network create --driver bridge edureka1

docker network create --driver bridge edureka2

docker network ls

Scenario 3:
*******************

Create 2 busybox Containers in network edureka1, and check if they can communicate

 docker run --name b1 -itd --network edureka1 busybox
 docker run --name b2 -itd --network edureka1 busybox

b1: 172.18.0.2

b2: 172.18.0.3

Both are in same network edureka1 ==> they can communicate with each other


Scenario 4:
*******************

Create 1 busybox Containers in network edureka2, and check if it can communicate with container in edureka1


 docker run --name b3 -itd --network edureka2 busybox

b3 : 172.19.0.2

b1 cannot communictae with b3-- different network


Scenario 5:
*************

Place the container in both the networks edureka1 and edureka2


$ docker network connect edureka2 b2




Scenario 6:
******************


Install a tool - Docker-compose:

systemctl start docker

curl -SL https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/v2.5.0/docker-compose-linux-x86_64 -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose


We write a docker-compose files

this file is written in YAML

purpose of compose file is to create multiple containers from multiple Images at the same time

Delete all the created containers


Create & Delete container at once.. using a command only if they create using docker-compose tool


Whenever you will exeucte creation of contaienr from docker-compose

a defualt networks - bridge will get created

in this network your container will be placed



**********************************

To initiate docker swarm:

$ docker swarm init

It will generate a token , copy token on ervery worker node for them to join the cluster

$ docker swarm join-token worker

To see various nodes in the cluster:

$ docker node ls

Object in Swarm that will create replicas of an Image:
*************
Service :will create replicas of an Image

SWARM : RAFT algorithm  will distribute the replicas to various node in the cluster

Create a Service in SWARM:
*******************

$ docker service create --name svc1 --replicas 4 nginx

List service in cluster

docker service ls

docker service ps mysvc1

Scale up and scale down replicas:
***************

$ docker service scale mysvc=4



Service when created will create multiple replicas, but how we can access it form browser
************

port mapping


1. Create a service of replicas 4 of image sonal04/samplepyapp:v1 and do port mapping

 $ docker service create --name mysvc -p 8181:3000 --replicas 4 sonal04/samplepyapp:v1



Volumes in Swarm:
**************

Storage of Container data in SWARM

Named volumes will be created in SWARM

option used is  : --mount

source: Name of the volume, which will get created in the same node as that of replicas

target: directory path of container whose data has to be preserved.

Command:

docker service create --name myservice --mount type=volume,source=myvol1,target=/mypath --replicas 3 nginx
